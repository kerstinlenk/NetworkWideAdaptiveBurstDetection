# NetworkWideAdaptiveBurstDetection

The network-wide adaptive burst depection algorithm can detect bursts (cascades of action potentials) in neuronal activity, typically measured with *in vitro* multielectrode arrays. The algorithm is implemented in Matlab. 

The repository includes the code for the publication: Välkki IA, Lenk K, Mikkonen JE, Kapucu FE and Hyttinen JAK (2017) Network-Wide Adaptive Burst Detection Depicts Neuronal Activity with Improved Accuracy. Front. Comput. Neurosci. 11:40. doi: 10.3389/fncom.2017.00040

Derivative of CMA algorithm
===========================
The algorithm is a derivative of the cumulative moving average (CMA) algorithm published in Kapucu FE, Tanskanen JA, Mikkonen JE, Ylä-Outinen L, Narkilahti S, Hyttinen JAK (2012) Burst analysis tool for developing neuronal networks exhibiting highly varying action potential dynamics.
